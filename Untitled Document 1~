They are but beggars that can count their worth.” 

Humanity says: “Its pain to see an underprivileged pleading while you are blossoming.”
Yes we are Humans!!!
Say NO to Child Begging!
 
Humans can speak and teach….
Act if you see any sweet child pleading!!
Stop Child Begging!
 
A begging hand will only bleed their heart more….
Show them a way.

 
The more you offer,
The more they will get used to begging….
 
 
Won’t it pain if we are at their position,
Teach not grant…

 
Child is an unbaked mold,
Don’t contribute them getting hammered…
Lets hand-craft their beauty…
Stop Child Begging!
